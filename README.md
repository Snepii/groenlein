### Menu:
- Draw everything on the canvas once and then just show the canvas.
- Show/hide menu by ID or similar method.
- Implement different screen/menu states (e.g., settings).
- Refactor the width/height/r functionality.
- Consider multiple constructors, if applicable. Also, find a way to make `---hint` show the string selections with `|` correctly.
- When the default menu has height `0`, it essentially becomes the circular one but stretched—fix overlapping boxes.
- Additionally, width `0` is effectively the circular menu.

### Smooth Scrolling:
- [Love2D `wheelmoved` documentation](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.wheelmoved)

### Garbage Collector:
- `collectgarbage(.., ..)`

### Resource Paths:
- Currently, resource paths are just strings—consider using path concatenation.

### Layered Drawing:
- Create a table with drawable elements and their depths/layers to ensure correct drawing order.

### Player Speed:
- Ensure player speed fits with tessellation.
