TODO
---------------
menu:
    - draw on everything on canvas once and then just show canvas
    - show/hide menu by id or something
    - states e.g. settings
    - the width/height/r mess has to be rewritten
    - multiple constructors maybe idk, also find out how to make the ---hint show the string selections with | properly
    - when default menu has height 0 its essentially the circular one but stretched -> fix boxes overlapping
    - additionally width 0 is literally the circular one



smooth scrolling:
